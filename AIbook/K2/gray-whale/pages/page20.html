    Pixel discovers the map for a dog. They don't need to memorize a billion pictures. They  just need to adjust their sliders.
    "BEEP!" Pixel goes.

        "If I slide the Legs to Long and the Ears to Buttoned, I get a Greyhound!" "If I slide the Legs to Short and the Coat to Smooth, I get a Dachshund!"
        By changing the sliders, Pixel can imagine every dog in the world.
