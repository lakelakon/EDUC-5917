        Pixel waited and watched as a new friend walked by, <br>
        With a coat red as fire and a spark in its eye. <br>
        They’d never met this kind of creature before, <br>
        No picture of this lived in their data store!

        "Let’s check," Pixel whispered. "Let’s look at the clues, <br>
        I’ll use all the logic that I’ve started to use. <br>
        Pointy ears? Yes! A tail like a curl? <br>
        The friendliest face in the whole world!"
