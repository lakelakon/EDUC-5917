        A flash in the dark, a soft metal thud, <br>
        Pixel landed their ship in the mud. <br>
        A robot from far, with a lens for an eye, <br>
        They’d come to see Earth from the sky.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0">
        Pixel had a big quest. <br>
        To put their brand-new computer to test. <br>
        They opened a folder, empty and small, <br>
        Labeled: "DOGS: I don't know them at all."
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0">
        "I have data to gather!" Pixel spoke with a glow, <br>
        "But what is a dog? I simply don’t know. <br>
        Is it big? Is it small? Does it meow like a cat? <br>
        I need to find where it’s at!"
